 ## About me:
 I'm 27 and I want to switch career. More than 10 years ago, when I was doing my first web page in a computer science lesson at school, I realized that I liked it, but then the first programming lessons and their close connection with mathematics scared me and I abandoned it for many years. Periodically I did some local web pages for projects at the university, but at the beginning of the year after moving, I clearly realized that I wanted to do this seriously. I started to study HTML, CSS on my own, just in case I signed up for a layout course, but in the process I realized that this format didn't quite suit me and decided to start studying js on my own and a couple of weeks later I started a new chapter of training with RS School.There is an opinion that moving squares is not interesting, but I really like to watch how lines of code turn a white screen in front of your eyes into something incredible, and the simplest js commands enliven the interface.

 ## Skills:

 * HTML5(Flex-box, Grid-layout)
 * CSS
 * elementary JS (just knowledge about arrays, objects, data types)
 ## Code
```javascript
var name = "vika";
var fullname = "viktorija";
if (name === fullname) {
    alert("Hey there"); 
        } else { 
         alert("Who are you?")   
}
```
